decisions

* wrt. programming lang/platform:
    * nodejs or directly html/js 
    * not stand-alone application, as I have no access to a macOS system on which I could test the application (which the platform the professor is using)
    * using something like react or gatsby?

* wrt. to the data set:
    * GHarchive seems like events only?
    * Snapshot of 2020 only + data acquistion of already pre-processed data

* wrt. to the build process:
    * write a script that downloads the appropriate data sets, as I am not sure if I am allowed to re-distribute them.

CSS will be included through CSS modules - was the easiest and cleanest for me. styled-components feels great, but makes the code widely unreadable for somebody not knowing what this does.

Write down a comment for one css stylesheet and one css module, just so prof volker cannot be mad
