# Project idea

The task is to develop any interactive visualization application with techniques learned in the lecture.
This is the exam for the master's program module "Visualization and Human-Computer-Interaction (VISH)" at the Hochschule Hannover, SS20.

## My actual idea

A information visualization project that tries to visualize some aspects of GitHub, its users and their usage of GitHub. 

Upon researching which data set I could use I followed the references given by our professor and stumbled upon [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).
I was particularly interested in using a data set which can be visualized in a graph, esp. of a large network (read: internet, tcp, etc.) topology, where I found a reference to a data set of a social network of GitHub developers.
That quickly evolved into an idea to use any GitHub data as this allowed me not only to display graphs, but also some smaller, simpler visualizations where I could fully apply the concepts learned in this lecture.

My previous idea, taking DotA2 data and visualizing professional game data, has been put on ice due to difficulties in accessing the data. It was either hard to get consistent, pre-processed data or hard to preprocess the data quickly enough. For this idea, I should have started atleast 2 months earlier.
Also, I think this would have been harder to get into as an outsider, i.e. somebody not familiar with the game.

## Requirements

Taken from the project description given by the professor:

* interesting, big enough data set (either from references in the lecture notes or subject of personal interest),
* suitable visualization techniques beyond simple bar or line charts,
* user interaction, e.g. selectable attributes, time instances, amounts of data, collapsible subtrees, ...
* user interface as well as (code) documentation in English

## Organizational details

* Use of Five Design Sheet methodology is mandatory
* Visualization application must be runnable either in Firefox or as a stand-alone application.
* D3.js is recommended by professor, but is no requirement.
