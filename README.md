# VisHub - visualizing GitHub events and more.

A information visualization project that tries to visualize some aspects of GitHub, its users and their usage of GitHub.

## Project organization

This project consists of two parts:

1. Design sheets 1 and 5 (Ideation and Realization) created through the use of the [Five Design Sheet methodology][1] 
   * Look inside [./design-sheets](./design-sheets) for more, or...
   * ... directly open [Design sheet 1](./design-sheets/submissions/VisHub-design-sheet1.pdf)
   * ... directly open [Design sheet 5](./design-sheets/submissions/VisHub-design-sheet5.pdf)
2. Implementing the chosen design from sheet 5 in an application

In this project, students (read: here just me) are getting familiar with the Five Design Sheet methodology in order to learn a more formal design process.
The professor acts as the client for our application.
By creating the design sheets, students (again, just me) are forced to externalize their internal thoughts which makes it easier to discuss the design ideas with their professor.
