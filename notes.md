# Notes

* pre-processed static data is okay
* not implementing all layouts is okay too
* color mapping seems wrong in the graph if there is no information behind it
  * either remove it or think of a metric you can bind to the color mapping
* edge bundling is not the same in d3 anymore, look into the lecture notes again for the references and either adapt a specific edge bundling algorithm yourself or drop it entirely
