## 5 Design Sheets methodology

## GitHub

Newer versions seem to be based on GraphQL:

### Ideas on differing visualization options

[Metabase allows for choosing different visualizations for the same dataset](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/users-guide/05-visualizing-results.html)

### D3

#### Ideas of visualizations in general built in d3

#### Search possibilities in a graph

[Search functionality in a d3.js graph](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41456008/search-functionality-in-a-d3-js-graph)

#### D3, Typescript and React

[Using D3 and React Together to Make Visualizations in TypeScript](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/07/20/d3-react-typescript/)
This one is pretty outdated but a good starter.
I adapted this one as a base for this project, and had to fix many errors that occured due to the use of older versions of TypeScript, React and D3.
